Description  
- My resume is black and white, literally. It is styled to optimize the amount of information an ATS (applicant tracking system) is able to identify about me. Sadly, to do that, I have to opt for standard formatting and static colors, but that doesn’t fully represent me or my personality. This website allows me to introduce myself to you, the user, in what I feel is a more personal way. With that said, hi, I’m Trinity Johnson and it’s nice to meet you.  
  
Technology and Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- Canva
    - A free website application I used to create my logo, avatar, social icon buttons, and project photos. I mainly used pictures and drawings provided by the application, minus the transparent social icons used to make my neon ones.
- Photopea
    - A free website application that allowed me to photoshop my avatar and website logo to my liking.
    
What I Learned

  -I had a bit of experience with HTML and CSS from teaching it to my younger students and working on the website my friend group and I created for a Hackathon but it wasn’t nearly enough to make a full multi-page website on my own. Using a series of youtube self-help courses and videos I was able to learn about the following:
    -Classes vs Id’s
    -Creating a Navigation Bar 
    -The Box Model
    -Flex Box
    -Grids
    -Inserting and Linking Documents
    -Creating and Linking Multiple Pages
    
Credits

  -The following youtube channels and pages helped me in broadening my knowledge of website creation and design. They provided tutorials and lessons on how to go about creating and designing a basic website; without their guidance, none of this would have been possible.
